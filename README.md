# Sales Data Analysis

## Purpose

It encompasses exploring sales trends over time, pinpointing the best-selling products, and calculating key revenue metrics such as total sales and profit margins.

## How to Use
Unfortunately the `.pbix` file of this project exceeds github's limit of 25MB, so it's not possible to git clone the dashboard, only the dataset.
